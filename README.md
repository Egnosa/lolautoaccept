Execute raw lolaccpt.py file or the .exe file from releases. **Your league client HAS TO BE 1280 X 720.** It is designed to be work in that resolution.

*In rare occacions, if you fiddle with client too much, the wavy animation can stick to your accept button, breaking the script. If that happens simply go to any other menu in client and come back to match search.*

The script will initially bring league client to front, so you dont need to do it yourself if you are going AFK, and it will locate the client window and calculate the match search and accept button locations. 

Script will click in interwals on the accept button location. It will only work if you are on match search screen, therefore if you are not afk, and doing other things, it will not hinder your other work, the moment your accept screen appears it will still click for you. 

*For whom it may concern, I don't do github stuff, so if there are any mistakes in my way of doing things feel free to share them with me. This is like a github learning test project.*
