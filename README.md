Execute lolaccpt.py file. **Your league client HAS TO BE 1280 X 720.** It is designed to be work in that resolution.

The script will initially bring league client to front, so you dont need to do it yourself if you are going AFK, and it will locate the client window and calculate the match search and accept button locations. 

Script will click in interwals to the accept button location. It will only work if you are on match search screen, therefore if you are not afk, it will not hinder your other work.
